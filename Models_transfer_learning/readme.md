# Model transfer learning


# Using ResNet50

Have first reworked the resNet50. For the moment it has 3 outputs and fully connected layer with 3 outputs. Than i tried to rework and change the last 3 layers after it has trained. For R-CNN implementation.

|Files   | Function  |
|---|---|
| test_model.m  | In this file we test the trained CNN  |  
| Adapt_for_cnn.m  | In this folder we change ur model to make it compatible for fast RCNN   |
| resNet_trained_1.mat |The model with all     |

# model reaction 


# data augementation 



For the moment it racts better with an black background. The parameters i'm using to train the model are the next.

|parameters  | Function  | Value   |
|---|---|---|
| adam  | Main function for the training process  |   |
| learning rate|How fast we converagance to an result |0.001    |
| mean/average |The noise function  |  |

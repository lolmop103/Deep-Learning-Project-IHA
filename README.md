## Components

### Images

It was decided to train with 3 different cans: Coca-Cola, Fanta Orange and San Pellegrino Clementina. Of these cans pictures were taken (in .jpg format) from all sides and in different angles. There are between 260-300 pictures per can. These are the pictures that will be used to train the model.
Furthermore, there are two extra cans added to the image set which can be used to test the model, to see how it reacts on cans that were not included in the training.

### Database

For the database their wasn't enough time to create one. So we made a json-file that consists of health information about how much you can consume of sugar and caffeine for an adult or a child.
Then their is also a way to access the can with a specific ID, like "coca-cola". This ID has the ingredients of that specific can and how much of it you can drink, until you hit the limit of sugar and caffeine.

The information about health was found on [gezondleven.be](https://www.gezondleven.be/themas/voeding/voedingsdriehoek) and the ingredients were found on the cans itself.

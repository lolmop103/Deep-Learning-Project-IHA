### Images

It was decided to train with 3 different cans: Coca-Cola, Fanta Orange and San Pellegrino Clementina. Of these cans pictures were taken (in .jpg format) from all sides and in different angles. There are between 260-300 pictures per can. These are the pictures that will be used to train the model.
Furthermore, there are two extra cans added to the image set which can be used to test the model, to see how it reacts on cans that were not included in the training.
